# ProductManagement
Created a RESTfull API using Java 8 with Spring Boot
I have used Oracle 10g database and have not implemented frontend.
Performed CRUD operations to add/update/delete products.
Created two separate repositories for Product and Discount.
We have to run the application in Spring Boot(Sts/eclipse).
To add inputs to the database, i have used POSTMAN.
We can add/update/delete products by entering the URL's(written for each operation) in POSTMAN.
And finally getProducts gives the JSON output as given.
